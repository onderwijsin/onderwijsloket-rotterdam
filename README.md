# Onderwijsloket Rotterdam

This is an open source single page application for Onderwijsloket Rotterdam. It is a Nuxt 3 app, using Nuxt UI and Tailwind CSS. It is meant to be deployed as a static app on edge runtimes (we use Cloudflare Workers platform); we have been doing so with [NuxtHub](https://hub.nuxt.com/).

The app is an extension of ``onderwijsloket-core``; a Nuxt 3 layer containing common config for Onderwijsloket apps, UI components and composables and other reusable logic. Currently ``onderwijsloket-core`` is in private pre-release, and thus this repo cannot be cloned without a Github Access token that has read permissions for the ``onderwijsloket-core`` repo.

# Favicons and other icons are automatically generated in different sizes and formats. Cloudinary is used to achieve this.
# Therefore, you need to add the CLD cloudname where your icons are hosted, and provide the public IDs for three icon variations
# IF you do NOT want to use Cloudinary, you'll need to completely override app.head.link property in nuxt.config.ts
ICON_CLD_CLOUD="onderwijsin"
